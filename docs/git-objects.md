Git Objects
-----------

# Step1: Git

Before we start writing Git, we should get acquainted with it:

1. Learn some popular Git commands: `add, commit, push, pull, fetch, reset`
2. Get some acquaintance with Git internals. This is a popular topic, so there are plenty of videos available, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvyqdQ3OjI) for example. Additionally there's a respective [chapter in Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects).

# Step2: Sha

You already have learned that any Git Object is represented by its hash based ID generated by SHA-1 algorithm. You task is to implement this:

```
class Sha {
    private final String hex;
    
    public Sha(String hex) {
        this.hex = hex;
    }
    
    public static Sha from(byte[] content) {
        ...
    }
    
    public String hex() {
        return hex;
    }
    
    public String toString() {
        return hex;
    }
}
```

Don't forget to write unit tests.
