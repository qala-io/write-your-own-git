Git Course
----------

There are 2 types of Git users: those who know Git internals and those who don't know Git at all. Meaning: the only way of actually knowing Git is by understanding how Git works under the hood. Luckily, the architecture of Git is beautiful and simple. And we'll try to reproduce some of it.

During this small course we'll write our own, simplified, version of Git. The reason to do this:

1. Well, learning Git
2. It's a good starting project for those who start their programming career. You'll learn some valuable programming lessons from it.
